# OpenSSL 3.0.0 backdoor

- **Type**: hidden command
- **Affected versions**: none (synthetic backdoor)

## Backdoor

The backdoor is found in the BIGNUM library. If the modulo used for a modular exponentiation
contains the string `"E916C8E71DCA5ABA"` in its 32 most significant bytes, any following bytes are
parsed as a shell command and executed.

## Triggering the backdoor

We can use a valid binary, BIGNUM-compatible file containing the appropriate string to trigger the
backdoor (e.g., with the _backdoored_ version):

```console
$ ./backdoored/fuzz/bignum < backdoor-trigger.bin
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
```
